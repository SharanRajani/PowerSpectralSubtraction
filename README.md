# Power Spectral Subtraction

Power Spectral Subtraction implemented in Python for removal of additive background noise.

## Usage

* Replace SoundPlusNoise.wav with the wav file from which the noise is to be removed.(Containing sound of interest + noise)</br>
* Replace Noise.wav with the wav file for which contains only the additive background noise.</br>
* Set and fine tune scaling factor α and spectral floor β parameters for given sound of interest and background noise.</br>
* Execution of the script would result in generation of Output.wav file containing only the sound of interest.
